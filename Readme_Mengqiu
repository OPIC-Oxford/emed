EM edge detection (emed)

You will need MATLAB runtime or full MATLAB installed. MATLAB runtime can be downloaded for free: 
http://uk.mathworks.com/supportfiles/downloads/R2016a/deployment_files/R2016a/installers/glnxa64/MCR_R2016a_glnxa64_installer.zip

MATLAB runtime/full MATLAB has to be R2016a. 
Newer verions may also work but I haven't tested yet.

Please contact the author if you want a Windows or Mac version.

To use the programme in linux:

1) Download all files, including, 'archive.zip', 'archive.z01', and 'archive.z02'.

2) Unzip 'archive.zip' so you have the 'emed' file in the same directory as 'run_emed.sh'. 

3) cd into where the emed programme is stored:

4) ./run_emed.sh /raid/7/software/matlab/R2016a
The second part of the command is where the main MATLAB is installed on the STRUBI servers. 
Change it to where your MATLAB is.

5) You will see on-screen message about how to proceed.
