You will need MATLAB runtime or full MATLAB installed. MATLAB runtime can be downloaded for free:

MATLAB runtime/full MATLAB has to be R2016a. Newer verions may also work but I haven't tested because they haven't been released yet.

To use the programme in linux:

1) cd into where the emed programme is stored:

2) ./run_emed.sh /raid/7/software/matlab/R2016a
The second part of the command is where the main MATLAB is installed on the STRUBI servers. Change it to where your MATLAB/MATLAB runtime is.

3) You will see on-screen message about how to proceed.
